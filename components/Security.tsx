        <SecurityFeature icon={<ShieldCheckIcon className="w-7 h-7" />} title="Smart Contract Audits">
          All smart contracts are simulations and for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, they would undergo rigorous, independent third-party audits to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
        </SecurityFeature>
        <SecurityFeature icon={<LockClosedIcon className="w-7 h-7" />} title="Non-Custodial Wallets">
          You are always in control of your funds. The protocol interacts with your wallet (like MetaMask) but never has access to your private keys. Your assets remain in your custody.
        </SecurityFeature>
        <SecurityFeature icon={<UsersIcon className="w-7 h-7" />} title="Decentralized Governance">
          The protocol's future is decided by token holders, not a central entity. All proposals and voting records are transparently recorded on-chain, ensuring a fair and community-driven evolution.
        </SecurityFeature>
        <SecurityFeature icon={<ShieldCheckIcon className="w-7 h-7" />} title="Transaction Transparency">
          Every deposit, withdrawal, and transfer is a transaction on the blockchain, publicly verifiable by anyone. This creates an immutable and transparent ledger of all financial activities.
        </SecurityFeature>
        <SecurityFeature icon={<LockClosedIcon className="w-7 h-7" />} title="Encrypted Data">
          While blockchain data is public, all off-chain interactions and personal data (if any were collected) would be secured using state-of-the-art encryption standards to protect your privacy.
        </SecurityFeature>
        <SecurityFeature icon={<UsersIcon className="w-7 h-7" />} title="Community Bug Bounties">
          To enhance security, a real protocol would run a bug bounty program, rewarding ethical hackers and security researchers for discovering and responsibly disclosing potential security flaws.
